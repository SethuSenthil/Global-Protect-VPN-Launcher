# Global Protect Launcher

Global Protect Launcher is a MacOS App designed to provide a convenient solution for toggling the Global Protect VPN connection. This app addresses the challenge of managing the Global Protect VPN, especially in situations like my CMPSC 311 - Introduction to Systems Programming class, where quick and easy control over the VPN is crucial for accessing Linux VMs. Currently, the app is tailored for MacOS, but contributions for other operating systems are welcomed.

## Purpose

The main purpose of Global Protect Launcher is to simplify the process of toggling the Global Protect VPN connection on and off. Unlike the default options, this app allows you to control the VPN connection without leaving it running 24/7 or resorting to uninstalling and reinstalling the app repeatedly.

## Features

- Enables easy toggling of the Global Protect VPN connection.
- Streamlines the process for managing VPN connectivity.

## How to Use

1. Download Global Protect Launcher from the [releases](link-to-releases) page.
2. Install the app on your MacOS system.
3. Launch Global Protect Launcher.
4. Use the app to toggle the Global Protect VPN connection as needed.
5. If the Global Protect app is already open, launching the Launcher (this app) will quit it. If it is not open, it will open it. Pretty simple tbh.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute and enhance support for other operating systems, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add support for XYZ OS'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-feature`.
5. Create a pull request.

Contributions are appreciated to make Global Protect Launcher even more versatile and user-friendly.
